<body>
Utility classes providing basic services to applications.
They are designed to help with error processing and with
the handling of operating parameters and simple files.
<p>
In most cases, methods avoid throwing checked exceptions but 
explicitly document exceptions. Illegal null pointers result 
in an IllegalArgumentException and are documented implicitly 
as part of the comment on the relevant parameter.
<p>
Exceptions thrown by utility classes come with a detailed message
and a cause chain making it possible in most situations to easily 
understand what went wrong.
